# Binary System
## My very first steps in Ruby

A friend has started to study, and needs to understand binary numbers. As I was learning Ruby anyways, I tested how much I had already understood Ruby; and built these simple programs.


* [binary01.rb](binary01.rb) = generates a simple table, to stare at it
  (execute at http://goo.gl/10OZ4b)
* [binary02.rb](binary02.rb) = more base-X systems; generalization helps understanding
  (execute at http://goo.gl/J8yuh5)


and * **taddaa** * ...

* [binary03.rb](binary03.rb) = **The Ultimate Binary Adding Machine** :-)
  (execute at http://goo.gl/u7qlsn)


### Manual:

1) click one of the 3 "execute-"links above. Wait.  
2) press "Execute".  
   Done! The output is appearing in the "Terminal" at the bottom.  

for the third program:  
3) Inside the green "Terminal" ... input your binary numbers.  

Good - isn't it?  

P.S.: You can change constants at the top of the scripts.
