Finally I started studying Ruby. Such a cool language. Here are some of my first code snippets.

* [explorative.MD](explorative.MD) - my "first contact" with this new world
* [ruby_manuals.MD](ruby_manuals.MD) - Ruby "Path to Enlightenment" - superb!
* [binary.MD](binary.MD) - my 1st own project
* [primetester.MD](primetester.MD) - my 2nd own project
* [ruby_OS.MD](ruby_OS.MD) - install & administer
* [LICENSE MIT](LICENSE)
