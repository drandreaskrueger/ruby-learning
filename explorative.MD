# Explorative Ruby

My very very first steps, in the early hours; "first contact" so to say.

* [rubyPredefVariables.rb](rubyPredefVariables.rb) Very interesting how many predefined variables Ruby provides. This prints them all.
* [rubyIDs.rb](rubyIDs.rb) Strangely hardcoded IDs
* [rubyAllMeth.rb](rubyAllMeth.rb) - VERY USEFUL: Study all methods of an object, see them executed
* [rubyFileIO.rb](rubyFileIO.rb) how to open files. Plus all 'file' methods.
